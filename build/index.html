Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
              <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

                  <p>As is the case with pretty much anyone, it's kind of difficult to put into words what I do, but I'll try: I make things better. I take anything that is or isn't tangible, and add or substract from it in order to make it better.</p>
                  <p>To be clear, I am very skilled at making ideas tangible using a wide range of software packages. However big or however small it does not matter, I can make it happen. I have worked for the biggest companies, and I have also helped the smallest players to get their feet wet.</p>
                  <p>I have a ton of experience with all kinds of software, hardware and concepts, from Adobe to Affinity, from Atom to Sublime, from R to Excel. Mac computers, homemade Windows computers, Linux computers, none of them are any problem whatsoever. And of course, Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote too.</p>

                  <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
